No conflicts of interest - no brokers, no affiliations, no signals. Education-only approach with full transparency. Passed Apex Trader Funding $25k evaluation. Multi-lingual: Arabic, German, English, Kurdish (fluent), Turkish, French (conversational).`,

Limited to 5 seats per quarter with rigorous screening. Price: $21,000 (Core), $45,500 (Alpha BLACK), $120,000 (Custom).

  // 4-Step Framework
  framework: `1. Context: Read volume, sentiment, liquidity. Define market regime. 2. Bias: 11-minute checklist turns context into directional bias. 3. Plan: Map levels, define risk, write entry/exit triggers. 4. Execute & Review: Execute with risk rails, score trade, log lesson.`,

  // Target Client
  targetClient: `Serious private capital owners - whether the wealth was built, earned, or inherited. Founders who exited, high-income executives who earned it, inheritors managing family wealth. Age 35-55. People who prioritize capital protection over speculation. NOT for signal-chasers, get-rich-quick seekers, or multi-market hoppers.`,

  // Core Value Prop
